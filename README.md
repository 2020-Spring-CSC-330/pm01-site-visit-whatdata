# PM01: Site visit

For Project Milestone 01, schedule a site visit with your service learning customer (the community partner you will be working for). The goal of the site visit is to learn more about the organization you will be working with. To truly develop a software application for your customer, you must understand the customer's work, including the people they work with (their customers), the product or service they are producing, and the purpose of the work. 

## Deliverables

Push to this repository by Friday, January 17th with:

1. The date you and your customer agree to the visit. The date you visit does not have to be before Friday, just an agreed upon date by Friday. 
2. A list of 5 questions you plan to ask your customer during this visit. 
3. The name(s) of the person(s) you will be meeting.
4. The location of the visit.
